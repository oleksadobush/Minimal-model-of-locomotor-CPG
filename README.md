CPG model for four-limb in Nengo

The central pattern generator (CPG) is a part of the human brain responsible for locomotion activity, including pattern and rhythm generation. 

We propose a CPG model for four limbs implemented with Nengo spiking leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons that expands previous research based on the analytical rate model. It accurately recreated empirical results, preserving the input-output linear relationship in phase characteristics, showing increased locomotion speed with increased drive. 

Moreover, we conducted “lesion” experiments with deleting a portion of flexor and extensor neurons to study the structural and functional changes. Our results showed the dynamics of four-limb locomotion in a simulated neural injury with progressive damage and showed one way in which it can be recovered with increased drive. With these findings, we can contribute to rehabilitating brain injury and creating quadrupedal biomorphic robots with accurate locomotion behavior.
